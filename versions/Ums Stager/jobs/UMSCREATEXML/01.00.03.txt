   Problem: Try to move a unit from yard A to B, then go to yard B. You will not see the unit there... until the stager changes the status to COMPLETED. Then user will need to refresh the yard in order to see the unit on the top left corner.
			Another test, on the same yard, move unit 1 from pad A to pad B, then to pad C... and quickly do a yard refresh... you will see that all 3 pads will be marked with XXXXXX, and the unit will not show. It will only show when the stager changed the status to COMPLETED.
			We need to think and see how we can solve this, without interfering on performance and not causing other side effects.
   
   Fixed: The SQL that is causing some problems was removed: "..yys.shusta_id != 7.."
