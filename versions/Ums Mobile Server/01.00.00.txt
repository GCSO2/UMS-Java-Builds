			  "Communication channel has been temporary lost, please complete/synchronize again to resolve the problem."

  Improvement: When creating an UPDATE RTMI, the outbound timestamp is null, can we please get the outbound inspection date populated with the current date and time. This date is not really important but is nice to have it for consistency.
  Improvement: when an UPDATE RTMI is created - populate the outbound Location ID with:
		a) [ IFNULL() ] Last RTMI inbound location ID for that unit, if NULL then ...
		b) [ IFNULL() ] Last RTMI outbound location ID for that unit, if NULL then ... 
		c) Location ID that has DEFAULT_FLAG=Y for the correct cus_id.

   Fixed: Stuck SO on Mobile side, The shunt app was not designed to have the PU and DO buttons being pressed within seconds from each other, doing so would cause sometimes conflicts with the background data transmission.
          Solution: Now is synchronization to Server in background mode (Do not more: PU button, DO button)
